So bright and blue  
So shine and bold  
So sharp and full  
I saw you so  

Please tie it back  
It’s so clearer  
Show me your smile  
I like you so  

Sweet as sugar  
Soft as a pillow  
Warm as a blanket  
That’s how you really are  

What can i do  
I want to show you  
How all these things  
Make me someone new  

How can i show you this love  
It’s killing me  
I’m so numb when i’m around you  

Nothing but you  
Make me someone new  
Losing my mind  
And i can’t explain
