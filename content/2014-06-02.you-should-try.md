You may say i have nothing  
You may say i have something  
It comes from your eye  
Baby, you should try  

Keep my eyes open  
Walking through the line  
Try not to look down  
Baby, you should try  

Don’t carry on  
For what i’ve done  
Cause i’ll be home  
Baby, you should try  

Stranded in blue  
Where they’re all gone  
But still i need some  
Baby, you should try  

I’m not what you are  
Baby, you should try  

When i was there  
Where they’re all gone  
When I’m on my own  
Baby, you should try
